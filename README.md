Welcome to the Analog Fiveband Equalizer Project repository! This project focuses on designing and building an analog hardware equalizer capable of adjusting audio signal gain across five distinct frequency bands. With control over bass, low midrange, midrange, high midrange, and treble frequencies, this equalizer empowers users to customize their audio output to their preferred tonal balance.

## Features

- Five adjustable frequency bands: Bass, Low Midrange, Midrange, High Midrange, and Treble.
- Rotary potentiometers for controlling gain in each frequency band.
- Hardware implementation using analog circuitry.

## Project Structure

- `filter designs/`: filter designs (with calculated resistor values) .
- `project design file/`: schematics and pcb designs (using altium).
- `simulation files/` : simulations of integrated filters using multisim.
- `images/`: Images related to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/analog-equalizer.git
